# Cool npm global packages

- `npm install -g git-split-diffs`
  To configure `git` to show better git diffs
  Very cool github-styled diffs on the CLI. However now I'm using Archlinux
  package `git-delta` which looks better.

- `npm install -g csv2json`
  To build JSON objects from CSV data.

- `npm install -g npm-check-updates`
  To see what packages need to be updated on a project.

- `npm install -g serve`
  Static file serving and directory listing.

- `npm install -g jsinspect`
  Analyzes code and reports duplicated code and other stuff

- `npm install -g json-server`
  Get a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously).
  For front-end work: mocks back-end

- `npm install -g speed-test`
  Runs a test on speedtest.net from the CLI
